1 - Laser powerup shot doesn't alternate. Might modify or leave as is (currently all 3 display as one shot)
2 - Mouse-enabled, nicer menus and start screen
3 - License? (finish) Readme?
4 - Load credits into game
5 - Game over screen pushes wave name off the bottom
6 - Boss tuning, art change?
7 - Particle effects (sometimes?) become suspended on player death
