1 - Laser powerup shot doesn't alternate. Might modify or leave as is (currently all 3 display as one shot)
2 - Display wave name in corner of level. Smooth animation to corner?
3 - Background image
4 - Mouse-enabled, nicer menus and start screen
5 - Find a way to fix thruster audio integration with game
