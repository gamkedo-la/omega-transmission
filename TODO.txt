1 - Laser powerup shot doesn't alternate. Might modify or leave as is (currently all 3 display as one shot)
2 - Background image
3 - Mouse-enabled, nicer menus and start screen
4 - Find a way to fix thruster audio integration with game
5 - License? Readme? (even though it seems previous projects don't have these things)
6 - Mouse remains pressed after release onscreen, allowing continued shooting.
7 - No sound on crash into enemy
8 - Thruster sound, etc. continue to play after death.
9 - Load credits into game
